Title: React 101: The Basics (Demo)

00:05 - Introduction to React.
00:15 - We will start by installing the project using Vite.
00:45 - Next, we define our Routes.
01:00 - Here is the router code:
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
01:30 - Now let's look at State Management.
01:45 - We use the useState hook for this.
02:00 - Example signal code:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(count);
}, [count]);
02:30 - Finally, we deploy the application.
